## Executive Summary 
This lab teaches you about python basics and goes in deep detail about graphics and how there are many versions of images. It introduces you to LucidChart which helps to create a flow chart that outlines a program and/or network. You learn abiut that connection between packet-switching, packets, IP address, protocol, and DNS. Also, you learn about the importance of the NSA.

## Python Code Examples
### Variable: 
They containers for storing data values. For example, I can say that x is my name and put "+ x" in the output to show my actual name so it is displayed
### Assignment statement: 
It assigns objects to names. The target of an assignment statement is written on the left side of the equal sign (=), and the object on the right can be an arbitrary expression that computes an object. For example, x = name.
### Function: 
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called​. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. 
### Desision making structure: 
Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome. Example of this are loops that use if, elif, and else.

## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Rasters are images that lose pixels when you enhance or enlargen them. Vector graphics are quite different from raster. You can make them any size, big or small, without losing quality. Vectors are made of something more complex than pixels. They're rendered using a special form of geometry. Raster graphics are best used for non-line art images; specifically digitized photographs, scanned artwork or detailed graphics. Graphic designers use vector graphics to create graphics that need to be scaled.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossless compression is that it allows you to retain the quality of your images while reducing their file size. For the quality of your images, you should choose lossless over lossy compression because lossy permanently gets rid of data. 
### File Formats
PNG supports 8-bit color like GIF, but also supports 24-bit color RGB, like JPG does. it allows the designer to change the amount of compression used. They are also lossless files, compressing photographic images without degrading image quality.
### File Properties
size: 394 MB (413,282,709 bytes)
Attributes are read-only and contents are indexed

## Lucidchart
In Lucidchart, allows a programmer to efficiently organize the inputs and outputs of a given program. It is a graphical way of describing a process, its constituent tasks, and their sequence.

## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
#### Packet:  The fundamental unit of data transmitted.
#### Packet-Switching: When a message’s packets are sent on the Internet, routers try to find the optimal route for each packet. This can result in packets being sent on different routes to their destination.
#### IP Address: A unique identifying number called an IP (Internet Protocol) address. Every device on the Internet (personal computer, a tablet, a smartphone, etc.) is assigned one.

#### DNS: Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com. It returns the IP address of the host requested, allowing for proper routing.

#### Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate  

### Networking Hardware
The reason why a switch is better than a hub is because of the bandwidth that is distributed. A hub that operates at 10/100 megabits per second (Mbps) must distribute the bandwidth evenly, giving 20Mbps to each node. A switch, on the other hand, delivers the full 100Mbps to each node connecting on the network. A router hardware and software that is used to connect multiple area networks (LANs and WANs), or two or more logical subnets.
### Network Topologies
#### Single point of Failure
In a single point, if the central hub or switch fails then the entire network goes down. 
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
Wireless mesh network provides stability when compared to the rest of the network topologies rather than the node addition or deletion in the network. It is redundent becuase it requires a lot of wireless access points. Infrastructure is stronger because it doesn't require the wifi to be so spread out and can have more wireless acess points depending on the the needs of the network. 
### Network Design
My design is an Infrastructure topology that has a switch that connects to computers. It also is connects the switch to wireless access point which connects to a printer.
### NSA/CSS
The NSA is responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign and domestic intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, specializing in a discipline known as signals intelligence (SIGINT). The are a team of mathematicians, analysts, copmuter scientists, and linguists that turn these signals into information and intel that can be used to counter terrorism.
## Conclusion
In conclusion, the new material that is crucial to learn because of it gives you a broad idea of what kind of content is in IT. It teaches you different types of topologies, network design and different types of images and their graphics.
